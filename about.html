        <p>
          Welcome to my personal portfolio!
          <br />
          <br />
          I am currently a senior at Virginia Tech studying Computer Engineering
          with a minor in Computer Science. I will be graduating in May 2024 and
          look forward to joining a company full-time soon after that. I am
          passionate about working with software solutions that make meaningful
          impacts on people's lives, so I am exploring job opportunities that
          will give me a chance to do just that.
          <br />
          <br />
          In my free time, I enjoy working out, getting outside and hanging out
          with friends and family.
