        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Growing up in a digital age, I have always been surrounded by
          technology. I still remember getting my first iPod like it was
          yesterday. I found technology fascinating and knew that I wanted to
          pursue a career in the field later down the line. I had only ever been
          the user of cutting-edge technologies like the iPod, Wii, or Alexa,
          and I never understood how the devices themselves worked. That changed
          in high school when I took my first Computer Science class which
          introduced me to coding.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This class taught coding fundamentals in Scratch and Python. Although
          coding was a confusing concept at first, I fell in love with the
          ability to create something with just a few simple lines of code. My
          passion for engineering and technology was solidified by other High
          School classes that I took that taught Web Design and Electronics
          basics. I decided to apply for Computer Science and Engineering
          programs around the East Coast, and now here I am a few years later
          ready to graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering!
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Present Day</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am currently a Senior at Virginia Tech and will be graduating this
          May with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering. I also have a
          Minor in Computer Science and a Focus in Networking & Cybersecurity.
          Outside of my coursework, I am a member of Beta Theta Pi, the National
          Society of Leadership and Success, and IEEE@VT. In my free time, I
          enjoy going to the gym and exercising, playing golf, watching sports
          (Go Hokies!) and spending time with friends and family.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This past summer, I worked as an Intern for Thorben Consulting LLC.
          During my summer at Thorben, I worked on an intern team that learned
          how use the AWS Management Console to develop, debug, and deploy
          cloud-based applications that follow AWS best practices. I was also
          able to acheive two AWS Certifications through the AWS Partner
          Network: the AWS Cloud Practitioner and the AWS Developer Associate. I
          look forward to joining a company full-time after graduation that will
          give me the opportunity to work with software solutions that make
          meaningful impacts on people's lives.
