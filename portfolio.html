            at Virginia Tech, I am teamed up with four other students tasked
            with completing a project given to us by an outside company. Our
            team is tasked with creating the overarching architecture for all
            Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport facilities. This involves developing
            a common interface for independent control systems to output to and
            provide the full visibility into all systems at all sites, including
            system architecture, networking, and GUI development for data
            visibility and manipulation. Our team meets multiple times per week
            in efforts to complete our deliverables by the time we have to
            present our Proof-of-Concept in April.

          <h3>FlexFlow iOS Fitness App</h3>

          <p>
            The final project of the iOS Development course completed with one
            other student. We were tasked with creating any iOS application of
            our choice in the Swift programming language. We were originally
            supposed to have three teammates, but due to a teammate dropping out
            of the course, we only had two. Despite this, we still finished our
            project with a perfect score and the highest grade in the class.

            <b>App Description:</b> FlexFlow is an iOS app that serves as an
            all-in-one fitness companion. This app offers users the ability to
            log and track their workouts with ease, allowing them to record
            sets, reps, weights, and duration, while also offering progress
            analysis and personalized recommendations. Moreover, the app
            provides an extensive exercise library that covers a wide range of
            fitness areas, such as bodybuilding, powerlifting, yoga, CrossFit,
            running, and more. Each exercise comes with detailed instructions,
            images, and videos, ensuring that users can learn and perform them
            with correct form and technique. By offering a seamless combination
            of workout tracking and exercise exploration across various fitness
            disciplines, this iOS app empowers users to achieve their fitness
            goals effectively and stay motivated on their fitness journey.

          <h3>Wireless Sensor Node</h3>
          <p style="font-style: italic">Aug 2022 - Dec 2022</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This was a semester-long project partnered with one other student as
            part of the ECE Integrated Design Project at Virginia Tech. In this
            project, we designed a single wireless sensor node prototype that
            can process and send temperature information through a transmission
            system. We did this using an Arduino Uno and a DC/DC Boost Converter
            on a breadboard that was thoroughly tested to properly charge a 9V
            battery.

            This project mimicked Google Chrome's "Dinosaur Game" that appears
            on a page not found error. I created this during my Embedded Systems
            course on an MSP432 microcontroller using C. I created a hardware
            abstraction layer and worked with Timers, Buttons and Joysticks in
            order to receive an A on the project.

          <br />

            This project read and displayed COVID-19 data sorted by US State and
            Race/Ethnicity as a part of my Software Design & Data Structures
            course. I worked alongside two other students to develop our
            solution, and we acheived the highest possible grade in the class.
            We implemented the front-end data visualization GUI and read data
            from a CSV file and sorted it on the back-end using Linked Lists in
            Java.
